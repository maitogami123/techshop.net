# Features Directory

This directory contains feature modules for the TechShop application. Each feature represents a distinct functional area of the application, encapsulating related components, services, and other artifacts.

## Purpose

The features directory implements a modular architecture that:
- Organizes code into cohesive, self-contained modules
- Enables lazy loading for better performance
- Promotes separation of concerns
- Facilitates scalability and maintainability
- Supports independent development of features

## Structure

Each feature module should follow this structure:
```
feature-name/
├── components/         # Feature-specific components
├── services/          # Feature-specific services
├── models/            # Feature-specific interfaces and types
├── guards/            # Route guards (if needed)
├── store/             # State management (if using NgRx/Redux)
│   ├── actions/
│   ├── reducers/
│   ├── effects/
│   └── selectors/
└── feature-name.module.ts  # Feature module definition
```

## Best Practices

When developing feature modules:
1. Keep features independent and loosely coupled
2. Implement lazy loading where appropriate
3. Use feature-specific routing modules
4. Share common functionality through core/shared modules
5. Follow Angular style guide conventions
6. Maintain proper component hierarchy

## Module Configuration

Example of a feature module setup:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { SharedModule } from '@shared/shared.module';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    // Feature components
  ],
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    SharedModule,
    RouterModule.forChild([
      // Feature routes
    ])
  ],
  providers: [
    // Feature-specific services
  ]
})
export class FeatureNameModule { }
```

## Available Features

List of current features and their purposes:
(Add features as they are implemented)

## Testing

Each feature should include:
- Unit tests for components and services
- Integration tests for feature workflows
- E2E tests for critical user journeys

## Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Create a new feature module using Angular CLI
2. Follow the established directory structure
3. Update this README with feature documentation
4. Ensure proper test coverage
5. Review existing features for shared functionality
6. Consider performance implications

## State Management

For features requiring state management:
- Use NgRx/Redux for complex state
- Implement proper actions and reducers
- Follow single source of truth principle
- Document state shape and interactions
