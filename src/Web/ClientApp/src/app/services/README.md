# Services Directory

This directory contains service classes that handle business logic and data operations for the TechShop application. Services act as an intermediary layer between components and external data sources (like APIs, local storage, etc.).

## Purpose

Services in this directory are responsible for:
- Making HTTP requests to backend APIs
- Managing state and data flow
- Handling business logic
- Providing reusable functionality across components
- Implementing data transformation and validation

## Structure

Each service file should:
- Be named with the `.service.ts` suffix
- Focus on a specific domain or functionality
- Follow the singleton pattern using Angular's dependency injection
- Include proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Be properly documented with JSDoc comments

## Best Practices

When creating or modifying services:
1. Keep services focused and single-responsibility
2. Use proper error handling and TypeScript types
3. Implement proper logging and debugging
4. Write unit tests for service methods
5. Document public methods and important logic
6. Use dependency injection for external dependencies

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ExampleService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
  
  // Service methods here
}
```

## Contributing

When adding new services:
1. Follow the naming convention
2. Update this README with service documentation
3. Ensure proper test coverage
4. Review existing services for similar functionality
